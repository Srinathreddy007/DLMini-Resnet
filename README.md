# DL-MiniProject
## Steps to Run the Code:
There are two ways to run this code:
<ol>
  <li>Using HPC</li>
  <li>Setting up an Anaconda Environment on the Local System</li>
</ol>

<h2>Steps to Run the Code on the HPC</h2> 
First create a directory in the <b>scratch</b> folder.</br> 
Type the following command to change the current directory to `/scratch/your_net_id/`:
   ```bash    cd /scratch/your_net_id/
   ```

There is `.sbatch` file in the Repo which needs to be modified to run the code on HPC Cluster.
